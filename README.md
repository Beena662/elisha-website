 Challenges Faced

Deployment Delay on GitHub

The main challenge was during GitHub deployment. Although I had designed the entire project within **3 days**, I faced issues uploading the images due to GitHub's file upload limits via browser.

 Solution

I researched and applied a step-by-step approach using online searches for images and GitHub tools to manually:

* Create the correct `images/` folder structure
* Upload image files in batches
* Configure GitHub Pages settings
* Troubleshoot missing paths or file references

This delayed the public hosting slightly, but the project was completed on time locally.

Dear **Sir Waleed Ahmad**,

Thank you for your patience, guidance, and support throughout this task. I appreciate your understanding during the GitHub deployment delay. The complete website was designed within the expected time frame of **3 days**, but publishing it live required additional technical steps that I have now resolved.

I am grateful for the opportunity and proud to present this completed project to you.

Respectfully,
